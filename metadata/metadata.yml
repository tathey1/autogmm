name: 'AutoGMM: Automatic and Hierarchical Gaussian Mixture Modeling in Python'
description: Gaussian mixture modeling is a fundamental tool in clustering, as well as discriminant analysis and semiparametric density estimation. However, estimating the optimal model for any given number of components is an NP-hard problem, and estimating the number of components is in some respects an even harder problem. In R, a popular package called mclust addresses both of these problems. However, Python has lacked such a package. We therefore introduce AutoGMM, a Python algorithm for automatic Gaussian mixture modeling, and its hierarchical version, HGMM. AutoGMM builds upon scikit-learnâ€™s AgglomerativeClustering and GaussianMixture classes, with certain modifications to make the results more stable. Empirically, on several different applications, AutoGMM performs approximately as well as mclust, and sometimes better.
