# Recreate Table 2, Figures 1-3, Figure 5

Here, there are 3 files corresponding to the different clustering methods.
Each file displays information about the chosen model (Table 2), and the final clustering (Figures 1-3).

The autogmm and mclust scripts additionally display the BIC curves for their different clustering options (Figure 5).

At the top of each script is a line that defines a variable called "dataset." This variable indicates the dataset on which the algorithm will run.
